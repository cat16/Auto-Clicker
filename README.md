# Auto-Clicker
This is a simple Java program that allows you to fake various (not that many atm) inputs from your mouse and keyboard using hot-keys.
## Current features
- `Right Alt + C` - spam clicks at the rate you set
- `Right Alt + H` - hold down left click for those of you too lazy to set something on it
- `Right Alt + T` - types whatever you typed in the text area at the rate you set (type racing ;) )
